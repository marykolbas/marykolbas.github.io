              <p>
                I regularly conduct exploratory analysis to make business intent recommendations that prioritize flexibility for customers while accounting for risk.
                I influenced senior leadership and partners across the company to launch feature awareness marketing campaigns for new and growing customer experience focused intents.

                <p>
                  I performed data analysis on Small Business Card (SBC) transaction decline data to improve customer-level underwriting in future policy adjustments and reduce charge-off risk using SQL and Snowflake.
                  I also gained storytelling skills, creating several presentations for upper-level SBC management.

              <p>
                  As a musician intern, I participated in monthly meetings to discuss the internal operations of a non-profit, 
                  planning promotional and fundraising events, and brainstorming ways to improve and expand the organization. 
                  I also wrote program notes and reviews for concerts, as well as play at additional community outreach events.
                  As a member of the social media team (2019-2020), I was tasked with brainstorming, designing, and promoting 
                  Instagram stories, Senior Spotlights, the Conductor Appreciation Series, and more. 
              </p>
              <p>I conceptualized, surveyed, designed and promoted the Conductor Appreciation Series (2020) from start to finish. </p>
