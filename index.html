                    My interests revolve around the <span class="color2">social impact of technology</span> and

                    I am especially driven to understand the future impact of emerging technologies on education, public 
                    awareness, and the way individuals interact with and treat each other, both online and in the real-world.

            building computers and AR/VR. We worked on several design challenges and projects within Cornell Tech, 
            Roosevelt Island, and NYC as a whole, including a 3D and AR visualization for

            <p>
                As a musician intern, I participated in monthly meetings to discuss the internal operations of a non-profit, 
                planning promotional and fundraising events, and brainstorming ways to improve and expand the organization. 
                I also wrote program notes and reviews for concerts, as well as play at additional community outreach events.
                As a member of the social media team (2019-2020), I was tasked with brainstorming, designing, and promoting 
                Instagram stories, Senior Spotlights, the Conductor Appreciation Series, and more. 
            </p>
            <p>I conceptualized, surveyed, designed and promoted the Conductor Appreciation Series (2020) from start to finish. </p>

                from scratch in PHP. This dynamic, server-side rendered website queries 
                a database using SQL and supports sticky forms, file uploads, functional login/logout, sessions and cookies, 
                filtering and sorting, and adding, editing, and deleting entries in the database. This project involved multiple user 
                personas including cognitive style facets, cognitive walkthroughs, sketch itterations, and more.

            <h3>Staying Sane At Cornell: Introductory Classes</h3>
            <p>This semester long project was inspired by the promp "Staying Sane At Cornell".
                My group of 5 focused on the stress surrounding introductory classes, especially due to their large class size, dense 
                material, differences in student's background experience, and the disconnect between professors and students. This exploratory project 
                involved ethnographic interviews, creating frameworks and prototypes, and multiple itterations.
            </p>
            <p>We presented our findings to a panel of Cornell administrators, including the Cornell Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.</p>

              This short project was created to explore an application of using Eigenvectors and
