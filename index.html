            <p><a href="https://www.floodnet.nyc/" target="_blank">FloodNet</a>, a community and government partnership that aims to better understand flooding 
                in New York City, tasked our team with improving transparency and public education 
                about the flood sensors located in their neighborhoods. Given New York City's past with government surveillance 
                and police abuse, the main goal was to educate the public that the sensors are not cameras, but rather 
                use sound waves to calculate rising floodwaters. We created a 3D animation and Web-AR prototype to be 
                accessible via QR-code at select sensors in high-traffic areas to provide transparency about this technology.
            </p>
            <p>I was responsible for the creation of the 3D models and textures in Blender, camera work within Blender, and scripting of the final animation.</p>

            <p>This semester long project was inspired by the prompt "Staying Sane At Cornell".
                My group of 5 focused on the stress surrounding introductory classes, especially due to their large class size, dense 
                material, differences in student's background experience, and the disconnect between professors and students. This exploratory project 
                involved ethnographic interviews, creating frameworks and prototypes, and multiple itterations.

            <p>We presented our findings to a panel of Cornell administrators, including the Cornell Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.</p>
