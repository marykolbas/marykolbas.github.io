                    My interests lie the intersection of technology and the humanities, particularly understanding how the connections and interactions 
                    between people are impacted by technology, both online and in the real-world. 
                    <!-- The impact of technology on online vs. offline social networks,
                    the optimization of transportation networks or manufactoring processes, and the impact of VR and online education on the next generation are 
                    just a few examples. -->

            <h3>Philharmonic Association Musician Intern</h3>
            <p>
                As a musician intern, I participated in monthly meetings to discuss the internal operations of a non-profit, 
                planning promotional and fundraising events, and brainstorming ways to improve and expand the organization. 
                I also wrote program notes and reviews for concerts, as well as play at additional community outreach events.
                As a member of the social media team (2019-2020), I was tasked with brainstorming, designing, and promoting 
                Instagram stories, Senior Spotlights, the Conductor Appreciation Series, and more. 
            </p>
            <p>I conceptualized, surveyed, designed and promoted the Conductor Appreciation Series (2020) from start to finish. </p>        </div>

            <h3>Playful Plants</h3>
            <p>For the INFO 2300 final project, I created a website for 
                <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/cornell-cooperative-extension/join-us/cce-summer-internship-program/playful-plants-guide-effective-integration-nature-childrens-outdoor-play-spaces" target="_blank">Playful Plants</a> 
                from scratch in PHP. This dynamic, server-side rendered website queries 
                a database using SQL and supports sticky forms, file uploads, functional login/logout, sessions and cookies, 
                filtering and sorting, and adding, editing, and deleting entries in the database. This project involved multiple user 
                personas including cognitive style facets, cognitive walkthroughs, sketch itterations, and more.

            <h3>Staying Sane At Cornell: Introductory Classes</h3>
            <p>This semester long project was inspired by the promp "Staying Sane At Cornell".
                My group of 5 focused on the stress surrounding introductory classes, especially due to their large class size, dense 
                material, differences in student's background experience, and the disconnect between professors and students. This exploratory project 
                involved ethnographic interviews, creating frameworks and prototypes, and multiple itterations.
            </p>
            <p>We presented our findings to a panel of Cornell administrators, including the Cornell Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.</p>

          <h3>Studying K-Pop Group NCT's Network Using Fiedler Set</h3>
          <p>
              This short project was created to explore an application of using Eigenvectors and 
              Eigenvalues to understand networks. Although a short paper, this project combines my interest in understanding the math 
              behind network connectivity and my love for K-pop.
